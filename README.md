# Movie-Management-System
Movies/films are the refreshment to an individual in now-a-days busy life. The Movie 
management system is an online database containing information and statistics about 
movies. It helps to inform the user about popular movies like description of a movie and rating 
of a film. The general user is assumed to have an interest in a wide variety of movies including 
comedy, drama, independent, horror, along with many others. So, this system will allow the 
users to find the genre of the film. This platform will encourage people to collaborate and 
share their opinions with each other.

part.
